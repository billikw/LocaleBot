# LocaleBot
A Discord bot which reacts to user's posts when they post ebay links (and others).

Primarily designed to detect when a user posts an eBay link. If an eBay link is detected, we then detect the suffix so we can determine the locale of the listing/user posting. This is to help people identify whether it is a relevant auction based on their location (i.e. a UK user isnt likely to be interest in USA auctions etc.). This bot makes it quick and easy for someone skimming market-place messages, to determine if it is indeed relevant, via reacting to the user's post with the flag of the countries origin and a left arrow, to catch your eye better.
